    <p>Sawasdee kha! I am 41 years old and from Udon Thani, Thailand. I recently married my eternal conpanion, 
    Rob. He is from the United States, and we are both members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. </p>
    <p>I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ for 9 years, and my trust and understanding of 
    Jesus Christ's love and good discipleship has increased in me day by day. </p>
    <p>I earned a bachelor's degree in international business administration and a master's degree 
    in business administration in general management from the University in Thailand. I like pink, like to travel. 
    enjoy running marathons and occasionally cycling I work in marketing. and print media design.</p>
    <p>I am fascinated by computers and new technology. I appreciate people who can use computer technology 
    to create new things, and I aspire to be able to do the same. Studying at BYU had always been a dream of mine, 
    but I never imagined I'd be able to do so. Until I learned about BYU Pathway through my husband's ward newsletter. 
    And it was here that I learned even more, which prompted me to pursue my studies at BYU Idaho.</p>
    <p>I love the quote from President Tomas S. Monson "Our task is to become our best selves. 
    One of God's greatest gifts to us in the joy of trying again, for on failure ever need be final."</p>
